data_pulling_01 in Car_crash uses API to pull the data, trim and export to CSV. The raw data downloaded from API is very big (~1Gb). Please do Not click run all for # data_pulling_01.ipynb # as it will take 30-60mins to run depends on network's speed.

Heat map requires Google API key to run. Need to put the google API key in before click run all or else it will throw error.
